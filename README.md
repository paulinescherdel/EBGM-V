This code repository is associated with the publication "Development, internal and external evaluation of an artificial intelligence algorithm for child growth monitoring". 

We provide the codes : 
- to model individual height trajectories using the Jenss-Bayley non-linear mixed model according to sex, 
- to develop age-specific predictive models by age range and obtain thresholds for a pre-defined specificity.

A fictive sample of the dataset is included in this repository as sample_G.rda (for boys) and sample_F (for girls). 
The full dataset is not publicly released due to privacy and licensing constraints.
